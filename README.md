# COVID-outbreak-simulation
This model is not designed to accurately predict real-time outbreaks of COVID-19, as the virus follows an unpredictable pattern and the results may vary with each run. It was developed during the pandemic based on observations of how the virus is transmitted, the approximate time of infection, mortality rates, vulnerability, infection rates, and other applicable patterns. While the program is not perfect and there is room for improvement, the project was inspired by various sources such as scientific research and expert analysis. It is important to note that this model should not be used as a sole source of information for decision-making regarding the pandemic, but rather as a supplementary tool to aid in understanding and analyzing the potential impacts of the virus.
